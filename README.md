considers the problem of the lane-change maneuver for automated vehicles in dense traffic on highways. To be able to safely change lanes or evolve in the same lane, an automated vehicle must follow certain safety conditions which include the condition that no vehicle enters the critical zone of another vehicle and that there is proper synchronization among nearby vehicles before making a lane change, which could be achieved by using the claim-reserve paradigm for lane-change maneuver, in which the vehicles first make claims to the target lane and if there is no conflict of claims, they change their claim to reserve and perform lane change operation else, they withdraw their claim. Finally, these safety conditions were verified using theorem prover KeYmaera X which is a powerful tool to verify hybrid systems that are modeled using hybrid programs and differential dynamic logic.
